The game is decent, combat feels similar to E7, the game is generous enough to satisfy most new players. Although one thing I have to say is that; optimize your game more. I'm running it in Infinix Note 12, which is enough to run ZZZ smoothly without any lags, as well as run HSR in medium resolution. I run this game with low resolution and the anti-processing is off. Still has white screens and a little lags."

Also, whenever I refin or power up said gear, it vanishes from the character and from the gear list. I have to log out, reequip, and repower up. Ever. Damn. Time. This isn't acceptable.

The rating is cuz this game is brutal to new players, every event is very hard and every stage you go the enemies lvls just get way higher. I can't even finish an event cuz the enemies just get too hard too fast. The same kinda goes for story but not as bad. You can either wait for strength and miss events or pay and play. And skins cost a lot of $."

It one of the better turn based RPG, the gameplay is smooth. The UI isn't too crowded either. The character designs are pretty neat, it's not overly reliant on fanservice to sell their art. The story is pretty generic, but the game does well and it adds character to an otherwise overused trope. The game's generous towards free to play users."
